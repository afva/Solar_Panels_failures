"# Solar_Panels_failures" 
The problem to be solved is a real-world issue in which the goal is to detect faults in solar panels through the analysis of thermographs. To achieve this, the images with faults and those without faults have been separated, and a transfer learning process has been conducted using a ResNet50 neural network (the Classes and Functions have tips)
